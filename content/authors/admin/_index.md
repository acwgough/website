I'm a second year PhD student at Newcastle University. Formally my PhD is in mathematics, but at heart I'm a physicist, and my research is focused on understanding the large scale structure of the Universe. In particular I study dark matter dynamics in the non-linear regime, and work on using and developing new statistical techniques for extracting cosmological information. I work in both the [theoretical cosmology](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/cosmology/) and [observational astronomy](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/astro-obs/) groups at Newcastle with my supervisor [Cora Uhlemann](https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/corauhlemann/).
