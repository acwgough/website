This is my personal website, which is hosted on GitHub and built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I use the
[Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic). I followed [this guide](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/) on getting Hugo installed so I can edit locally, using ```> hugo server``` to build local versions of the site before pushing to the web.
